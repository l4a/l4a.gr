So does lighting. Applications that deal more with the technical one (e.g. road lighting) can easily be described as “good” or “bad” and can be easily documented by norms and guides. For applications that have to do more with the aesthetic dimension (e.g. facade lighting) is really hard to tell.</p> <p>So is there a “Holy Grail” of good lighting? Taking into consideration that there is no common sense of “good” <em>the answer is NO</em>. There are no 100% safe rules and directions that can lead to “good lighting” especially when the aesthetic dimension is dominative. Here’s some of my personal criteria in this subjective evaluation.</p> <nav class="toc"> <ul id="markdown-toc"> <li><a href="#lighting-a-3d-world">lighting a 3d world</a></li> <li><a href="#contrast-its-all-in-the-luminance-distribution">contrast: it’s all in the luminance distribution</a></li> <li><a href="#the-enemy-human-vanity">the enemy: human vanity</a></li> </ul> </nav> <h2 id="lighting-a-3d-world">lighting a 3d world</h2> <p>Let’s face it. We live in a 3d world, or it’s better to say that humans can perceive only 3 of the dimensions of the universe (I don’t know how many of them are counted according to the latest theories).</p> <p>Very often I see buildings with “flat” lighting that turns the 3d structure into a 2d surface. By “flat” i mean lack of depth, lack of shadows, lack of scale. It’s true that sometimes lighting is designed to be flat due to architectural aspect. It’s also true that “flatness” could have a visual interest, but in most of the cases the image of a flat lighted building just comes and goes from the eyes.</p> <p>In <a href="http://l4a.gr/images/searching-for-a-holy-grail-that-does-not-exist-01.jpg" class="image-popup">this case</a> the lighting designer transformed a flat lighted surface into an eye catching volume by simply adding an inner blue light (complementary to facade’s yellowish color).</p> <h2 id="contrast-its-all-in-the-luminance-distribution">contrast: it’s all in the luminance distribution</h2> <blockquote> <p>“When you are courting a nice girl an hour seems like a second. When you sit on a red-hot cinder a second seems like an hour. That’s relativity.”</p> </blockquote> <p>That’s how Einstein humorous described relativity. Taking in mind that the human eye can confront to a huge range of luminance (from 1E-6 cd/m2 to 300.000 cd/m2) can easily be assumed that relativity has also to do with lighting. It doesn’t matter how much an object is lighted but it does matter how much is lighted in relation to another object or with its background and surroundings.</p> <p>Absolute values of illuminance and luminance are useful as a starting point but more useful is for example the knowledge of the materials of a facade and the luminance of the local site, things that can define what we call contrast or luminance distribution. In Greek countryside one can see a lot of heavy floodlighted castles and monuments in the pitch black landscape. Looking at one of these from a distance you got the impression that the USS Enterprise has landed on the top of a hill. Lower lighting levels or a graduated surrounding lighting could have helped in this case.</p> <p>Here’s the same <a href="http://l4a.gr/images/searching-for-a-holy-grail-that-does-not-exist-02.jpg" class="image-popup">stop frame</a> with Grace Kelly &amp; James Stewart (from Hitchcock’s “Rear window”), on the left in low contrast and on the right in high contrast. Contrast triggers feelings. Mastering in contrast - Mastering in lighting. I think that’s a rule of the thumb.</p> <h2 id="the-enemy-human-vanity">the enemy: human vanity</h2> <p>Vanity is the reason for every disaster in human history. KISS principle stands against this self-destructive human tendency. The phrase behind the acronym is Keep It Simple and Small. Instead of a theoretical approach on how KISS can be applied in lighting take a look at the next pictures.</p> <p>In <a href="http://l4a.gr/images/searching-for-a-holy-grail-that-does-not-exist-06.jpg" class="image-popup">this hotel</a> the lighting solution is simple (a small floodlight on every inner corner) and follows the architectural pattern. Repeating lighting gradients create a very interesting composition (despite the bad maintenance and the bad photo from a phone camera).</p> <p>On the other hand <a href="http://l4a.gr/images/searching-for-a-holy-grail-that-does-not-exist-07.jpeg" class="image-popup">this hotel’s</a> lighting (it’s on the same road 2-3 Km away) looks pretentious and cheap (blue color makes it more pretentious and even more cheap). In visual appliances sight abstraction can be realized in a positive or negative way. Negativity may be eye concentrative but for commercial establishments sooner or later it is proofed as money decreasing. People’s majority may cannot explain why this is good or bad but surely can separate good from bad.</p> <p>National road 1 that connects Athens with Salonica lies trough an industrial area near Athens. At about 60-70 Km from Athens you can see <a href="http://l4a.gr/images/searching-for-a-holy-grail-that-does-not-exist-03.jpg" class="image-popup">this excellent example</a> of industrial lighting in which you can notice the right quantity of light, the right luminance distribution, the right choice of colors and the right modeling.</p> <p>About 50km from this spot and only 10 or 20 Km from Athens you can see maybe <a href="http://l4a.gr/images/searching-for-a-holy-grail-that-does-not-exist-04.jpg" class="image-popup">the worst lighted building on planet earth</a> (I tried not to over or under expose the photo). The lighting here accomplishes something that even David Copperfield is doubtful if he can: to disappear the building!</p> <p>Approaching to that building at night you can see from kilometers away <a href="http://l4a.gr/images/searching-for-a-holy-grail-that-does-not-exist-05.jpg" class="image-popup">the sky glow</a> of the intolerable floodlighting. The light trespass, the light pollution and the indubitable annoyance of the animals here is minor considering the danger of car accidents due to extreme glare. Drivers confront thousands of candelas.</p> <p>The funny thing is that the publishing company which owns this paper distribution establishment, in some of its dozens of newspapers, magazines and websites, has hosted many articles about light pollution.</p> <p>NV</p> <hr/> <footer class="page-footer"> <div class="page-meta"> <span>Updated <time datetime="2012-10-26T00:00:00Z" itemprop="datePublished">October 26, 2012</time></span><br/> </div> </footer> </div> </div> </article> </div> <footer role="contentinfo" id="site-footer"> <p class="social"> <a title="Follow us on Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/lightingforarchitecture"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i></a> <a title="Follow us on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/@L4Agr"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i></a> <a title="Follow us on LinkedIN" href="http://www.linkedin.com/company/l4a"><i class="fa fa-linkedin-square"></i></a> <a title="Follow us on Google+" href="https://plus.google.com/118175561586753944372" rel="publisher"><i class="fa fa-google-plus-square"></i></a> <a title="Subscribe to our Feed" href="http://l4a.gr/atom.xml"><i class="fa fa-rss-square"></i></a> </p> <p class="copyright">&#169; 2012&#8211;2014 <a href="http://l4a.gr">Lighting for Architecture</a>.
