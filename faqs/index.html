Normally, professionals with different areas of expertise deal with each type of lighting.</p> <hr/> <h2><a href="/faqs/professional-lighting-designers/">Isn’t your job “sort of the same as” what a professional lighting designer does?</a></h2> <p class="decrease">Not at all! A professional lighting designer uses (at least theoretically) materials from the full market spectrum and prepares very detailed studies, for which he charges accordingly. His job includes natural light designs, and may also include theatrical or event lighting in general. L4A does work in partnership with lighting designers, and if necessary, commissions them to prepare designs that require time and detail.</p> <hr/> <h2><a href="/faqs/just-lighting/">Do you also do general interior design, not just lighting?</a></h2> <p class="decrease">No. There are experts for that job (such as architects and interior designers) who can help you with that. There are some very talented ones in Greece. If you like, we can recommend some.</p> <hr/> <h2><a href="/faqs/buy-lights-on-my-own/">Why shouldn’t I buy lights on my own, or with the help of an electrician?</a></h2> <p class="decrease">Easy solutions can generate unpleasant results. Don’t forget that lighting affects vision and mood. Proper lighting is good for the eyes and the soul.</p> <hr/> <h2><a href="/faqs/trading-company-and-design/">If you’re a trading company, why do you prepare designs?</a></h2> <p class="decrease">When talking about professional lighting, but also home lighting too, you shouldn’t just go and install lights first without having taken into account important factors such as lux levels, uniformity of light, glare, contrast, etc. A lighting design takes account of all those factors, and depending on the project requirements can be something quite simple, or an exceptionally complex task.</p> <hr/> <h2><a href="/faqs/tangible-picture/">Can you give me a tangible picture of how things will look properly lit?</a></h2> <p class="decrease">Yes. In addition to providing numbers and technical details that many people might have difficulty understanding, we can give you a quite reliable picture of how your space will look with the lights on.</p> <hr/> <h2><a href="/faqs/the-right-time/">When’s the right time for a lighting design to be prepared?</a></h2> <p class="decrease">If the lighting design is done before construction work begins, when the architectural design is finished, you can avoid a lot of mistakes and make major savings.</p> <hr/> <h2><a href="/faqs/free-or-not/">Are the designs free of charge or not?</a></h2> <p class="decrease">Because L4A collaborates with specific lighting manufacturers and specifies their products, the general rule is that designs are free of charge. That’s the case for the vast majority of projects. In other words, the design is a pre-sales service we offer. The only exception to this is projects entailing a very large volume of work. In those cases, we charge a small fee to cover the man hours involved.</p> <hr/> <h2><a href="/faqs/skills/">How skilled is your design department?</a></h2> <p class="decrease">We don’t like to brag or use grandiose, pompous words. Let’s just say the design department is staffed by people who know what they are doing. Ask to see examples of our work.</p> <hr/> <h2><a href="/faqs/how-far/">How far does the lighting design go?</a></h2> <p class="decrease">It covers light groupings and recommended circuit routes. It’s up to the electrical engineer to do the calculations relating to cables, load distribution, electrical panels, and so on. We usually work in tandem with him to ensure that our lighting design is a <em>good fit</em> with his design.</p> <hr/> <h2><a href="/faqs/save-energy/">Will I save energy?</a></h2> <p class="decrease">Definitely! L4A always make sure that it takes that factor into account, but not just in terms of savings from light bulbs. Don’t forget that energy savings can also arise from the proper layout of lighting and having just the right number of lights.</p> <hr/> <h2><a href="/faqs/lighting-control/">Can lighting be controlled centrally to allow me to dim and programme lights or create mood lighting, etc.?</a></h2> <p class="decrease">Of course! Ask us about lighting control systems. They’re easy to install and straightforward to use.</p> <hr/> <h2><a href="/faqs/lighting-consultant/">What does a lighting consultant do?</a></h2> <p class="decrease">A lighting consultant is someone who is responsible for your project and whose purpose is to meet your needs as best as possible. He will listen to you, monitor the design, place the order and in many cases will also monitor installation and will deal with any problems that arise during the entire process.</p> <hr/> <h2><a href="/faqs/pricing-policy/">What’s your pricing policy?</a></h2> <p class="decrease">The manufacturers L4A collaborates with usually have a single price list, at least within the European Union. That means you’ll find the same product with the same retail price in any EU country. Having said that, every agent offers a discount and part of that can be rolled over to his customers.</p> <hr/> <h2><a href="/faqs/big-discount/">Why can’t I have a really big discount like the one another company gave me?</a></h2> <p class="decrease">Quite simply because L4A doesn’t use bad, misleading commercial tactics like overinflating its prices in order to be able to give major discounts.</p> <hr/> <h2><a href="/faqs/e-shops/">Why is exactly the same light cheaper in e-shops?</a></h2> <p class="decrease">That’s only to be expected. An e-shop doesn’t have the overheads that an architectural lighting firm may have (staff, designs, project supervision, etc.).</p> <hr/> <h2><a href="/faqs/order-arrival/">How many days does it take for the lights to arrive after I place the order?</a></h2> <p class="decrease">Normally speaking, our delivery periods don’t exceed 2 weeks. However, in some cases delivery times can be 4 to 5 weeks.</p> <hr/> <h2><a href="/faqs/range-of-products/">Is there a wide range of products available? Are the products sufficient to cover the needs of each and every project?</a></h2> <p class="decrease">Our primary objective is to work in partnership with manufacturers to cover the greatest possible range of lighting applications.</p> <hr/> <h2><a href="/faqs/out-of-range/">What happens if the products I need include some not in the range offered by companies you cooperate with?</a></h2> <p class="decrease">We will let you know about this and you can either procure the lights directly from the agent or we will procure them for you at the best possible price.</p> <hr/> <h2><a href="/faqs/bespoke-products/">When do you design bespoke products? What’s the manufacturing process involved?</a></h2> <p class="decrease">There are some cases where the architectural design requires innovative lights or certain innovative structures that incorporate lighting. In cases like that, working with the architect or designer, we manufacture a bespoke product. Depending on the material involved, the parts are fabricated by reliable Greek firms and assembled at our workshop. We carry out the appropriate checks to ensure that they match the design, and also check the quality of manufacture and electrical and mechanical protection. We also check that they work under various special conditions if that’s necessary, checking for water-tightness, load-bearing capacity, etc. Once we are certain that everything’s ok, the lights are installed.</p> <hr/> <h2><a href="/faqs/installation/">Do you also install the lights?</a></h2> <p class="decrease">No. but if you want, we can recommend specialist teams that do this.</p> <hr/> <h2><a href="/faqs/defective-product/">My product is defective! What happens now?</a></h2> <p class="decrease">L4A ensures that it collaborates with reliable European manufacturers to ensure the best possible product quality. However, sometimes there are defects, as with all mass-produced products. If the defect is due to manufacturer error, L4A will ensure that the product is replaced as quickly as possible.</p> <hr/> <h2><a href="/faqs/guarantee/">What guarantee do the products come with?</a></h2> <p class="decrease">All products have a 2-year guarantee. Some specific products have a 5-year guarantee.</p> <hr/> <h2><a href="/faqs/new-lighting/">I can’t get used to the new lighting! What’s going on?</a></h2> <p class="decrease">If there is no obvious problem (such as intense glare) that concerns you and you are simply having difficulty adjusting, then in all likelihood everything went well! Bear in mind that the human brain needs time to adjust to new lighting conditions. After a few days everything will seem normal, and you’ll be able to assess the upside of the new lighting scheme.</p> <hr/> <h2><a href="/faqs/returns/">Can I return products that I don’t want to keep for whatever reason?</a></h2> <p class="decrease">No. We do not accept returns.</p> <hr/> <h2><a href="/faqs/cheap-copies/">Why shouldn’t I just buy cheap copies of the lights you’ve suggested?</a></h2> <p class="decrease">We could give you 100 reasons for not doing so, but someone else might give you just as many reasons for doing so. That’s not the issue. What you need to do is ask yourself whether you would buy a CD from a street vendor, whether you would buy a cheap version of some designer clothing, or whether you would buy a fake watch? If the answer’s yes, then why not go ahead and buy cheap copies of the lights we’ve suggested.</p> <hr/> <h2><a href="/faqs/holistic-approach/">What’s your opinion about the “holistic approach” to lighting that various companies promise?</a></h2> <p class="decrease">Without wanting to generalise, Katie Henderson (<a href="https://twitter.com/hondohondohondo">@hondohondohondo</a>) put it perfectly when she said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Holistic approach: “Let us do everything for you, we need the money.”</p> </blockquote> <p>What we’ve opted to do (and our clients tell us we are doing it well) is to sell reliable products and provide effective pre- and after sales service to our clients.</p> <hr/> <h2><a href="/faqs/greek-products/">All the manufacturers you work with are foreign. Do you have some problem with Greek products?</a></h2> <p class="decrease">None whatsoever! On the contrary, we are pleased to see quality products made by Greek hands. However, as is the case with most sectors of industrial production, the truth is that Greek lighting manufacturers invest little in fields such as research, innovation and design. That doesn’t mean that there aren’t specific products from specific Greek firms that we use.</p> <hr/> <h2><a href="/faqs/cheap-products/">What’s your opinion about the numerous, cheap products (mainly LED lights) that have inundated the market?</a></h2> <p class="decrease">We have no problem with the idea of cheap. A cheap product doesn’t necessarily mean it is bad quality. Never forget these words though. There’s a lot of truth in them:</p> <blockquote> <p>“The bitterness of poor quality is remembered long after the sweetness of low price is forgotten.”</p> <p>– <cite>Aldo Gucci</cite></p> </blockquote> <hr/> <footer class="page-footer"> <div class="page-meta"> <span><i class="fa fa-clock-o fa-fw"></i> &nbsp; Updated <time datetime="2014-09-10T21:46:57Z" itemprop="datePublished">September 10, 2014</time></span> </div> </footer> </div> </div> <div class="sidebar"> </div> </article> </div> <footer role="contentinfo" id="site-footer"> <div class="wrap"> <nav role="navigation" class="menu"> <ul class="footer-links"> <li><a href="/">Home</a></li> <li><a href="/about/">About</a></li> <li><a href="/projects/">Projects</a></li> <li><a href="/articles/">Articles</a></li> <li><a href="/faqs/">FAQs</a></li> <li><a href="/contact/">Contact</a></li> <li><a href="/sitemap/"><i class="fa fa-sitemap"></i> Sitemap</a></li> </ul> <ul class="float-right social-circles"> <li><a href="https://twitter.com/L4Agr" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'link', 'click', 'Twitter follow');"> <span class="twitter fa-stack fa-lg"> <i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i> <i class="fa fa-twitter fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i> </span> </a></li> <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/lightingforarchitecture" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'link', 'click', 'Facebook follow');"> <span class="facebook fa-stack fa-lg"> <i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i> <i class="fa fa-facebook fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i> </span> </a></li> <li><a href="https://plus.google.com/118175561586753944372/" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'link', 'click', 'Google+ follow');"> <span class="google-plus fa-stack fa-lg"> <i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i> <i class="fa fa-google-plus fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i> </span> </a></li> <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/l4a" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'link', 'click', 'Linkedin follow');"> <span class="linkedin fa-stack fa-lg"> <i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i> <i class="fa fa-linkedin fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i> </span> </a></li> <li><a href="http://www.pinterest.com/L4Agr" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'link', 'click', 'Pinterest follow');"> <span class="pinterest fa-stack fa-lg"> <i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i> <i class="fa fa-pinterest fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i> </span> </a></li> <li><a href="http://l4a.gr/atom.xml" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'link', 'click', 'RSS follow');"> <span class="rss fa-stack fa-lg"> <i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i> <i class="fa fa-rss fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i> </span> </a></li> </ul> </nav> <p class="to-top"><a href="#masthead"><i class="fa fa-arrow-up"></i> Back to top</a></p> <p class="copyright">&#169; 2012&#8211;2015 <a href="http://l4a.gr">Lighting for Architecture</a>.
